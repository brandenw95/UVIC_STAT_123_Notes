## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, given a problem/question and some data, you will be able to write R code (a Statistical programming language) to graphically visualize and summarize the data. You will be able to interpret the graphs and summary statistics thus providing an answer to the problem/question posed. You will also be able to produce professional looking reports with all appropriate information you want to convey.

In the programming language R, you will be able to:

- Load data into R.
- Check the quality of the data.
- Prepare data for analysis purposes.
- Summarize the data.
- Visualize the data.
- Conduct basic statistical analysis, such as:
  - Estimate population parameter(s).
  - Conduct simple statistical modelling.
  - Interpret the model.
  - Evaluate the fit of the model

## Evaluation and Grading

| Assignments   | Lab Participation | Midterms          | Final Exam |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| Every 2 weeks | Weekly            | May 31, July 12th | TBA        |
| 20%           | 15%               | 30% (15% each)    | 35%        |

### Assignments

Approximately every 2 weeks you will be given an assignment based on materials covered in lectures and labs (combining theory and practice using R). You will have one week to complete the assignment and submit it for grading. While collaboration with your peers (such as discussing questions and reviewing one anotherâ€™s work) is encouraged, your submitted work must be your own. Work that appears copied will be given a grade of 0. Violation of academic integrity will be dealt with according to university policy.

### Lab Participation

Each week you will be given a worksheet in lab which will help you
put concepts learned in lecture into practice using RStudio. A specialized tutorial leader will help to guide you with a demonstration and then will give you time to work on your assigned problem. You will submit your completed lab worksheet soon after the lab to be graded

### Midterms

There will be two midterm tests during the semester. The tests will be held on Wednesdays during lecture or lab time. The dates for these tests are May 31 and July 12th If you miss a test for an unavoidable reason (such as illness or family affliction), then you may be excused but you have to contact me as soon as possible. Your test score will be assigned at the same rank as your performance on the final exam (Ex: If you rank 30th on the final then you are assigned the 30th ranked mark on the test). 

If you miss both tests for an unavoidable reason then the weight will be moved to the final exam so long as the weight of the final does not exceed 60%. This will mean that
there is a 5% penalty. I will contact you to explore other options

### Final Exam

A 3-hour final exam will be held at the end of the term. The examination date is to be determined by the University and is usually released around the end of June. The examination period is August 8th - 18th, 2023. Students are strongly advised not to make plans for travel or employment during the final examination period as special arrangements will not be made for examinations that conflict with such plans

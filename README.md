## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, given a problem/question and some data, you will be able to write R code (a Statistical programming language) to graphically visualize and summarize the data. You will be able to interpret the graphs and summary statistics thus providing an answer to the problem/question posed. You will also be able to produce professional looking reports with all appropriate information you want to convey.

In the programming language R, you will be able to:

- Load data into R.
- Check the quality of the data.
- Prepare data for analysis purposes.
- Summarize the data.
- Visualize the data.
- Conduct basic statistical analysis, such as:
  - Estimate population parameter(s).
  - Conduct simple statistical modelling.
  - Interpret the model.
  - Evaluate the fit of the model

## Evaluation and Grading

| Assignments   | Lab Participation | Midterms          | Final Exam |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| Every 2 weeks | Weekly            | May 31, July 12th | TBA        |
| 20%           | 15%               | 30% (15% each)    | 35%        |

### Assignments

Approximately every 2 weeks you will be given an assignment based on materials covered in lectures and labs (combining theory and practice using R). You will have one week to complete the assignment and submit it for grading. While collaboration with your peers (such as discussing questions and reviewing one anotherâ€™s work) is encouraged, your submitted work must be your own. Work that appears copied will be given a grade of 0. Violation of academic integrity will be dealt with according to university policy.

### Lab Participation

Each week you will be given a worksheet in lab which will help you
put concepts learned in lecture into practice using RStudio. A specialized tutorial leader will help to guide you with a demonstration and then will give you time to work on your assigned problem. You will submit your completed lab worksheet soon after the lab to be graded

### Midterms

There will be two midterm tests during the semester. The tests will be held on Wednesdays during lecture or lab time. The dates for these tests are May 31 and July 12th If you miss a test for an unavoidable reason (such as illness or family affliction), then you may be excused but you have to contact me as soon as possible. Your test score will be assigned at the same rank as your performance on the final exam (Ex: If you rank 30th on the final then you are assigned the 30th ranked mark on the test). 

If you miss both tests for an unavoidable reason then the weight will be moved to the final exam so long as the weight of the final does not exceed 60%. This will mean that
there is a 5% penalty. I will contact you to explore other options

### Final Exam

A 3-hour final exam will be held at the end of the term. The examination date is to be determined by the University and is usually released around the end of June. The examination period is August 8th - 18th, 2023. Students are strongly advised not to make plans for travel or employment during the final examination period as special arrangements will not be made for examinations that conflict with such plans

# Chapter 1

## What is Data Science?

![image-20230503130343869](assets/image-20230503130343869.png)

### Overview

Statistics is the science of data. In this Chapter, we learn some introductory terms related to data and we look at some examples to help illustrate these terms. We will also begin to formulate questions about finding data which we will eventually answer later on in the course.

> Note: Descriptive stats only - Summery of data

### Motivating example

More so now than ever, the world is paying attention to statistics. Daily updates on COVID-19 can include number of new infections, positive test rates, mortality rates, vaccination rates, as well as plots of an infection rate curve which we are trying to flatten. Depending on the source, the information being given can paint very different pictures. Are all of these sources equally reliable? Is the data accurate? Is the data being manipulated in a misleading way?

Whenever confronted with data, one of the first and most important questions that should be answered is: Where does the data come from?

- Reputable sources
- Government 
- non-profit organizations 

### Definitions

#### Individuals / Observations

> **Individuals / Observations**
>
> Objects described by a set of data.
>
> Note: Individuals are not necessarily persons, they can be animals, etc.
>
> **Example:** 
>
> - Hospital Patients 
> - Owls
> - Tress



#### Variables

> **Variables**
>
> Any Characteristic of an individual
>
> **Example**:****
>
> - Blood pressure 
> - Height
> - Size
> - Breed of dog

### Example 1 (Starbucks)

A Starbucks employee decided to collect information about several of their menu items. Consider the resulting data set:

| Menu Item    | Price | Weight(in g) | Drink? (Yes/No) |
| ------------ | ----- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Cappuccino   | $4.75 | 473          | Yes             |
| Banana Bread | $3.45 | 115          | No              |
| Dragon Drink | $5.15 | 473          | Yes             |

> Note: Tables in R are called data frames.

1. What are the individuals in this data set? Select all that apply.

- [x] Menu Item 
- [ ] Price
- [ ] Weight
- [ ] Whether it is a drink

2. What are the variables in this data set? Select all that apply.

- [ ] Menu Item 
- [x] Price
- [x] Weight
- [x] Whether it is a drink

### Definitions

#### Categorical Variable (Nominal Variable) 

> **Categorical Variable (Nominal Variable)** 
>
> Variables that cannot be ranked. Places an individual into one of the several groups or categories.
>
> <u>Example:</u> "Whether it is a drink"



#### Ordinal Variable

> **Ordinal Variable**
>
> A variable we can establish and rank.
>
> <u>Example:</u> "Weight" and "Price"



#### Numerical Variable (quantitative variable)

> **Numerical Variable (quantitative variable)**
>
> Takes numerical values, it can be used to perform meaningful arithmetic operations such as averaging.
>
> <u>Example:</u> "Weight" and "Price"

How do we decide what variables to collect in our data?

- Depends on the data.

> Note: 
>
> - Categorical Variables can be numbers. (Ex. 0 or 1 for yes and no)
> - No meaningful operations cannot be done on this.

### Example 2 (Recycling Habits)

When trying to judge the recycling habits of a neighborhood, researchers went around weighing the recycling bins of each household. They found that certain streets (with more expensive houses) had heavier recycling bins and other streets (with less expensive houses) had lighter recycling bins. Does this mean that the more expensive your house the more you recycle?

<u>The individuals:</u> The Households of the neighborhood. 

 <u>The variable(s):</u> Weight of recycling bins, cost of the house, number of residence in house, type of house.

<u>Type of variable(s):</u> 

- Weight - Numerical 
- Cost - Numerical 
- Residents - Numerical 
- Types of house - Categorical

<u>Problem with the variable(s):</u> 

- Weight determine level of recycling?
- Different house types, different recycling contents

### Definitions

#### Population

> **Population**
>
> The entire group of individuals about which we want information.

#### Sample

> **Sample**
>
> A Sample is a subset of a population. If done correctly, we can use a sample to draw a conclusion about a population. (Inferential Stats)

### Example 3 

1. You wish to measure the mean weight of 5 month old Koala bears so you find twenty 5-month old Koala bears and weigh them.

- <u>Population:</u> All 5-month old Koala Bears
- <u>Sample:</u> Twenty 5-month old Koala Bears



2. You decide to look at all of the uncollected Stat 123 midterms from the Spring 2019 semester. Using this you make a report of the average number of mistakes a Stat 123 student in Spring 2019 made on midterms.

- <u>Population:</u> Stat 123 Students in Spring 2019
- <u>Sample:</u> Students that didn't collect their midterms.



3. You want to determine the number of wine drinkers in Victoria BC so you loiter inside the Liquor Plus store located at Quadra and MacKenzie on Monday January 11th from 3pm-5pm and count the number of people who buy wine at the store.

- <u>Population:</u> All people in Victoria
- <u>Sample:</u> shoppers at liquor stores located at Quadra and MacKenzie on Jan 11th 3pm-5pm.



> Note: Not all samples are good samples. We will discuss this idea further in later sections but if you choose a bad sample, it is not going to accurately describe the population.
